## Q&A (I asked myself)

### Why is there another user with an almost identical name (broner3D)?
***
**A**: Well my account got locked (I think it got locked or I got reset) and I couldnt get in so I asked github to get my account back (this is what I remember cuz it was long ago), so then they unlocked my account but it was a new account called GITHUB_IAMHERE, so I renamed it to broner2D and here we are, but I dont think this is what happened as when I checked my email account to see the story I seen an answer from github saying that wait times were longer, some password reset requests (made by me I know). And some other emails after I renamed it to broner2D
